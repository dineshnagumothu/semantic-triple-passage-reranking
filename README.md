# Semantic Triple Assisted Learning For Question Answering Passage Re-ranking

<ol>
  <li><b>Create environments</b></li>

  This step creates separate environments for OpenIE6 and sentence-transformers. (Single environment setup will not work because of conflicting packages)
  
  ```
  sh setup.sh
  ```

  <li><b>Extract Triples and Generate Coverage/Overlap Scores</b></li>

  This step prepares the data, extracts OpenIE6 triples from questions and passages and computes the coverage/overlap scores and saves them to disk. 

  You can edit the settings in the bash file to define the number of GPUs ```NUM_GPUS``` to use, positive to negative ratio ```POS_NEG_RATIO```, and number of samples ```MAX_SAMPLES``` to process
  
  ```
  sh feature_generation.sh
  ```

  <li><b>Train and Evaluate the Passage Re-ranking model</b></li>

  This step trains and measures the performance of the re-ranking model with cross-encoder architecture

  Feel free to experiment with different language models, and change ```MODEL_NAME``` to any HuggingFace encoder models. This work experiments with BERT-base ```bert-base-uncased``` and ERNIE-base ```nghuyong/ernie-2.0-base-en```.  You can also select ```FEATURES``` as ```coverage``` or ```overlap``` to alter the loss function using the specified scores
  
  ```
  sh feature_generation.sh
  ```
</ol>

Currently, this repo supports MS MARCO dataset. Support to QUASAR-T and TREC 2019 DL Track is coming soon.
